# OCPs (Optimized Coarse Propagators)

## overview
This repository focuses on the training process and examples of Learned Coarse Propagators(LCPs), a class of coarse propagators(CPs) which specially designed for specific fine propagators(FPs). 

## Training process

 In the file 'Ex_linear', we provide the necessary code to replicate Example 4.1 from our study. To execute this example and view the results, run the script named 'Ex_XXX.m'.

 The files 'Ex_semilinear' and 'Ex_Burgers' include the code for Examples 4.2 and 4.3, respectively. These examples further illustrate the application of LCPs in different scenarios. To execute examples and view the results, run the script named 'run_XXX.m'.
